# CineSync - Organize Your Media Library Easily

CineSync is a comprehensive media library management system designed to efficiently organize libraries for Movies & TV shows, eliminating the need for Sonarr/Radarr. With its modern web interface, real-time monitoring, and advanced automation features, CineSync streamlines the organization of your library while providing full control over your data locally. While highly optimized for debrid platforms, CineSync is also versatile and works effectively with non-debrid platforms.

# How CineSync Works ?

CineSync creates symbolic links from source directories to destination directories, organizing them according to your preferences and metadata from TMDb/IMDb/TVDB. This approach allows you to maintain a well-structured library without physically moving or duplicating files, preserving disk space while enabling advanced organization features.
